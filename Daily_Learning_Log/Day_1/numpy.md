## ⚡ Background: Python vs C

Initially, **Python** was considered a slow programming language, this made it unsuitable for **Machine Learning**.


## Comparing **C vs Python**:

**⏭️ C (Dennis Ritchie’s philosophy):**  
- Manual memory management  

- Direct interaction with hardware  

✅ Primarily used for system-level programming, operating systems, drivers, and performance-critical software.


**⏭️ Python:**  
- Simpler programming language

- High-level abstractions → write less code, focus on logic

### ✨ The Cost of Abstraction

- Python supports versatile data structures like Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets  

- Even then, translating high-level Python code into machine instructions is time-consuming => Because of this high layer of abstraction


---

##❌ Python alone was unsuitable for **Machine Learning**.

### 💡 The Solution: NumPy

✅ Not a built-in Python package 

✅ Implemented in **C and Fortran**  

✅ Enables **Python to handle huge data fastly by Brings **C-level speed** to Python  **

### 🔢 Why NumPy is a Mathematical Library

NumPy arrays are:  

- **Homogeneous**  

- **Fixed-size** 

⚠️ NumPy supports strings technically, but its true strength is **numeric computation**.


---


### 🎯 Final Takeaway

- Python alone was too slow for Machine Learning.
  
- **NumPy** bridges the gap between Python’s simplicity and C’s speed => Making it suitable for machine learning
